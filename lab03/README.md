# Train a model with Amazon SageMaker Autopilot

In this assignment, you will train a text classification model using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot. The lab will include the following sections:

Dataset review

Configure the Autopilot job

Launch Autopilot job

Track Autopilot job progress

Feature engineering

Model training and tuning

Review all output

Deploy and test best candidate model

# SageMaker Autopilot job consists of the following high-level steps:

Data analysis where the data is summarized and analyzed to determine which feature engineering techniques, hyper-parameters, and models to explore.

Feature engineering where the data is scrubbed, balanced, combined, and split into train and validation.

Model training and tuning where the top performing features, hyper-parameters, and models are selected and trained.
