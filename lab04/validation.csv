__label__1 "there 's not much to add to what reviewers have said . beautiful flowing light-weight fabric . flattering cut . gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery . a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up . this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer . you would n't find it anywhere else . i 've had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment some of the embroidery is coming loose . it 's gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t"
__label__1 "i tried this on at antho today and loved it ! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors . it is flattering in person . the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer but this is probably better anyway with spring coming ( it is coming right ? -today it 's snowing ) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it . it is versatile and could be paired with anything ."
__label__1 "these make your rear look ah-maz-ing ! ! ! i mean seriously good . every time i wear these my husband can not keep his hands off . usually i 'm 27/28 in these i took a 29. perfection . i also got them in the black and blue washes . i may not be wearing any of my other jeans at this point . so good . awesome price point too ."
__label__0 "this is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting . i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i do n't need to show but if you 're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear this would be super cute ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited for this kimono . i thought the colors would be lovely . i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono . i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled . sadly i was not . this arrived and fell short on all measures . the colors were flat the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $ 108 . it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop . back it went . i ended up buying the silves wrap which i love ."
__label__1 "this dress is perfect for my florida lifestyle because of the fabric and the design . it is not the color pictured on the web page which was a disappointment . the color is a lot duller . i tried it on in the store and found it to be tight across the chest another lady who also tried it had the same problem . i went home and ordered a larger size . that dress was baggy and not as cute in the back . i realized because of the under slip it could be left open to the waist and work just fine . i ended up"
__label__0 "skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric . was not flattering and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50 $ to get it tailored . usual size oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large . the pattern on the skirt and the nuetral color is very nice . if you can find one that fits would be a nice 3 season skirt !"
__label__1 "i had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited ! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body . i love the bottom of it it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back . add an ada wrap belt and perfection !"
__label__0 "i found both colors and jumped on this shirt . then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless . there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it it is too hot to wear in the summer putting a tee under ruins the look . i am very flat chested so it hung well but there is lots of shirt . both went back in exchange for two wearable items ."
__label__1 "love my jeans fit great and very flattering . they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit . receive compliments every time i wear them . if they go on sale i will buy another . : )"
__label__-1 "i probably should have gone with petite . this dress was just awful on . the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be . it hits me about thigh level . it 's very unforgiving clingy and shows every bump . i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy . it 's going back ."
__label__1 "they fit me great are super comfortable . they are casual yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs . they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions . i love them with booties : ) . i think they look better in person than online too"

__label__-1 "i wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing . the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online . once i pulled it out of the bag my first thought was how could retailer send me a used washed and shrunken sweater . it is nothing like the picture . it fits like a midriff top not exaggerating . i 'm 5.6 ordered the m do n't waste your shipping money on this ."

__label__0 "this is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i could n't for a few reasons i thought i 'd share : the color is bright orange . it is not softer like peach in the picture . it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear . i thought 'd be more swingy but it was more structured . very pretty and good quality tho ."
__label__-1 "the fit is so bad and the construction is very poor . i 'm 5 ' 1 '' 100 lbs ordered xxs petite . first of all when i button this there is extreme gaping going on . the vest runs narrow yet tall ? it shifts up my torso if i move at all making the gaping even worse . the skirt at the bottom is made of a very cheap thin slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market . it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled and it was just so thin . it did not meet as closely in the middl"
__label__-1 "the length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering . i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting ."
__label__1 "picked this up at the local retailer in both colors . the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought . highly recommend ."
__label__-1 "this fell apart after wearing it once . for the price it should hold up better . it 's too delicate ."
__label__1 "great fit perfect length ! so happy with these jeans . the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel . very soft - love these jeans !"
__label__0 "so this dress is extremely comfortable but it 's just really awkward . i am on the fence about keeping it my husband loves it and thinks i should . it just draws attention to the belly so any issues after having kids is very noticeable . not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms . very comfortable but not sure if i will keep it ."
__label__1 "i found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price . it 's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down . it 's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering . i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit . definitely worth the sale price !"
__label__1 "these pants are perfect for any casual occasion . they can be worn to run errands hang around the house or even go out with friends . i love how versatile they are and they are so roomy for those times when you do n't want to wear jeans or anything tight . they are a bit pricy but i 'm very happy with how they fit ."
__label__1 "this jumpsuit is great dressed up or down . the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long ( but that was an easy fix ) ."
__label__0 "purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on . when i got home i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right . i took them back and tried them in the next size . they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me . i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either . i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online ."
__label__-1 "maybe i should n't have sized up to an xl but i 'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit . the vee is quite low and i 'm busty . it 'll be really low if you 're smaller on top . the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me . not tight at all . it 's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view i looked like a really wide green apple . i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i would n't recommend it ."
__label__0 "this top is very pretty but it does n't make up for the problems with it . retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late . the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased do n't seem to hold up to normal use and washing . i normally wear a medium in tops . the medium in this top was huge . i needed an extra small which means a lot of people are sized out of this top . i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk ! it shrunk so much that i can"
__label__-1 "i love the look of this dress but it runs very large . i am 5 ' 2 110lbs . i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it . i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it 's sheer but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu . even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it . i 'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good ."
__label__-1 "the shirt is cute but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct -- it 's a crop top . this was returned ."
__label__1 "cute layered cami . great colors for summer or fall . very light fabric tends to get a bit staticy . shorter in the back than expected but a good versatile top"
__label__1 "i love anna sui 's lines makeup to everything . this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on i could n't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow . the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big . the hem is lovely scalloped . each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress there is no wow that justifies the full price tag . now that it 's on sale i 'll keep it probably for summer ."
__label__1 "this skirt is not only cute but really comfy . i really like the materials it 's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way . i 'm 5 ' 2 so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist . love this skirt !"
__label__-1 "this romper is cute well-made and true to size but i have n't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties . which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on . not sure what the designers were thinking here . i 'm returning this one ."
__label__0 "but-the problem is i can not get the color to stay below the shoulders . the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that did n't lay right . if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me . i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves but i ca n't get the desired look to work out so this is going back ."
__label__1 "i got this shirt in an xxsp and it has a great slim body . the front ruffle is n't overpowering although i do n't love the ruffles on the sleeves . i think it 's just a little too much but they are n't visible under a sweater or jacket . the length is just right so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy . the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through . it 's a good shirt ."
__label__-1 "i 've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks . it is already tearing at the seams somehow . the quality of this is very poor ."
__label__0 "i had really high hopes for this dress and i am still unsure if i 'll keep it or not . i ordered both a small and a medium because i was unsure of this brand . the small fit ( im usually a 4 s/m at retailer - 34b 140 lb 5 ' 8 ) just like it does on the model only the photo online gives the illusion that this is a slight fit-and-flare dress . this is a shift with pleating subtleties on the bustline that bring it in slightly . also the colors should be more like blue multi because there 's a bright a"
__label__-1 "this top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure . i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular curvy frame . this top adds about 20lbs ."
__label__0 "i love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model . i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though ."
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much . the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer and would work in an office . but on me the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms ( saggy or fat area ) in a comical manner . if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad the couldnt have done it better . further the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point ( i am hourglass ) . again not flattering"
__label__1 "oh my ! this dress fits wonderfully on ! so ready for autumn ! i have a big bust this dress does not split at the buttons ."
__label__1 "i love these jeans . they can be dressed up or dresses down . super cute with tall boots or loafers . i wear them all the time ."
__label__-1 "like most people here i wanted this beautiful dress to fit . so i decided to see for myself if maybe just maybe the negative reviews were wrong . they were n't . if you have any sort of breasts at all the top probably wo n't fit properly . i imagine a narrow upper torso like a 32 or 33 possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly but with a 36 c i could not get a size 12 to button up . the waist hit at a strange spot and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this top ... and while it is soooo amazingly soft i still could not keep it . i must admit that i am only 5 ' 2 so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this ... but i felt like a matador which is definitely not what i was going for ... maybe if your tall and lean this would work . but for me no way ."
__label__-1 "i was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail . the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck . that being said i was so disappointed in the fit . i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped . cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides . made no sense ! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit . order up for length down for arm length ..."
__label__1 "i bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer . store but they didn & # 39 ; t have my size . someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up . i probably would have bought the xs but it was gone . i went with it a little oversized and love it ! great quality and workmanship on the embroidery . more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005 ! super cute love it !"
__label__0 "overall a very nice and unique dress . it does have too much going on but can be worn in a versatile way and if you are small chested without a bra . i am not a big fan of the material i wish it was softer . it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for !"
__label__0 "i 'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand . i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small ... and i agree . while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear it 's tight in the shoulders and chest . for the record those are 2 areas i never have problems with . i 'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest . it was also quite short on me . i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button . the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12 ."
__label__1 "i think the model photo does n't do this dress justice . it 's comfortable and perfect for a summery day . i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan and of course it works well causally . i 'm busty -- d on a small frame -- but there 's not gapping . the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish ."
__label__1 "this pants are very comfortable and add a little flare to my typical mom pajama look . i found them true to size ; size small fit my 5 ' 7 135lbs frame . comfortable to sleep and lounge in !"
__label__1 "this is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own . i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway . the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable yet cute . i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique yet whimsical swimsuit style ."
__label__0 "this was huge on me ! otherwise i thought it was a nice top slimming . i did n't bother looking for another size though . i got a medium . i wear a small or medium ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this ... it 's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue but that 's where the positives end . i ordered the xs and it was huge . wide shapeless and way too long ( i 'm 105lbs and 5 ' 1 ) . even if it came in petite i 'm not sure it 's worth the price because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out ."
__label__-1 "i have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive . this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat . the sleeves are very wide ( although long ) . as a light weight fall coat the sleeves do n't need to be as wide because you would n't be layerng too much underneath . the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit . i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh"
__label__-1 "frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me ; maybe better on someone younger ..."
__label__1 "i love wearing this . it is a little slice of summer which i am desperately hanging on to . the color pops it 's so very comfortable & the back is a work of art ! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt or down with capri style pants ."
__label__-1 "loved the sweater and the sale price was great but i could not take the shedding ! even after just trying it on the first time my jeans and top had shedding all over them . this was 2 minutes i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day . had to return ."
__label__1 "this tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts ! jeans work well too and during cooler seasons i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm . the fit of this top is not true to size for it runs large but is flattering on the body nonetheless . the stripes and miniature circular openings i noticed add beautiful detail for formal or informal events . as a whole this shirt is perfect ! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material"
__label__-1 "i saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself . i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light . i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips . i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape . if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it . it is beautiful ."
__label__0 "ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews . i loved this shirt . it was amazing . fit perfect was so comfortable . then i washed it . ahhhh . it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it . i washed it according to the tag . then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk . man . i wish i could return these shirts . they are so bad . and i typically love bordeaux quality . these are horrendous ."
__label__0 "very soft material length is great a little more loose than i would have liked ."
__label__1 "i agree the pictures are confusing . the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate . this is such a great dress ! it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicer/dressier looking in person than i imagined it would be . i think it fits true to size . i either wear a 4 or a 6 in most retailer dresses and the 4 in this dress fits me well . i 'm planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon ! i definitely recommend !"
__label__-1 "this is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear . this brand makes some of the softest cutest tees but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry . not worth the cost ."
__label__-1 "i liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough but the thin fabric does not justify the price . it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two ."
__label__1 "the print caught my eye . then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on . i am only 5 ' 2 '' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well .. this dress fit me perfectly ! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments . this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny ."

__label__0 "i loved the dog on this sweater and i rushed into the store to buy it . once i tried it on like others i did find it to be itchy but that i could deal with using a tank or something . what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut . my arms looked much bigger than they are so sadly i left it at the store . it really is a cute sweater though ..."
__label__0 "this is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger a nice blue and a good transition piece . but the upper arms are so tight on me ! i 'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin but not large either . i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it but sadly i just do n't think the material will be very forgiving . if you have truly thin arms i think it would be a great top . maybe sizing up would also work but for me at least i think it"
__label__-1 "the sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on however the material is thin and slightly see through . also after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear . after the third time i wore it i discovered a large hole in the armpit most likely due to the excessive washing . i would not recommend this sweater ."
__label__-1 "there are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted . not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress . i wish the pictures shown were more accurate ."
__label__1 "what a great shirt . however none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture . the front of them are all a deep blue color no tie-dyed effect or whatever you 're seeing on the online pics . the shirt runs large . i am an 8/10 38c and the smaller size was plenty big . i ca n't imagine how the larger size would have looked ! i think this top will go with many things including as a cover up over dresses ."
__label__0 "these pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size which may not be what you usually wear . i have several pair but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability . retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product . now that said i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants and the outcome was successful . i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t"

__label__1 "true to size so great fit from top to bottom . i am 5 ' 5 '' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low . it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area . it is very soft and comfortable . the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing ."
__label__-1 "maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers . usually fall in love with a blouse only to look at the tag and discover it 's by maeve ( go figure ) . this top is just atrocious though . does nothing for girls with a larger chest . very boxy and unflattering . gorgeous colors though and the sleeve concept is cute . however where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on . not impressed ."
__label__-1 "this cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined but it is boxy and totally un-fitted . i swim which means i have large shoulders and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line . the sleeves are too long and as usual retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system so if you choose to close this cardigan it just looks awful ."
__label__-1 "i tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger . but it 's basically cut for model-sized people only . it 's short and wide and if you have any boobs at all it 'll make the back pucker . i ca n't imagine this will look good on most women ."
__label__-1 "this runs way big i 'm a size 8 purchased the medium . it 's just big with no shape ."
__label__1 "super cute and simple shirt ( as other reviewer said lol ) . but she was right ! i have another shirt from this brand and it 's one of my favorites . it runs true to size . it 's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall . it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i 'm only 5 ' 2 and i would n't want it to be any shorter ."
__label__-1 "i opened the package and the dress is two pieces . it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over . the sweater was too short for me as i am busty and would not work . i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i did n't try it on ."
__label__0 "should have ordered the xl instead of the large . did n't even come close to being able to button the front but i 'm a 34 g. i find sanctuary to run small . beautiful soft green color fabric is soft too . it is cropped to the waist . decided to return instead of reorder ."
__label__0 "i think these are amazing for anyone over say 5 ' 5 . the way these hung on me ( at 5 ' 2 ) were very unflattering in the front . they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them . that 's all i can say without being crass ."
__label__0 "those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast . this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture . also the material is quite thin which makes the snug part look unflattering . they were not for me unfortunately ."
__label__-1 "yikes ! quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool . the color was beautiful but the sweater is enormous ! strange fit under the arms as well . this one went back the same day ."

__label__-1 "i purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer 's recent 20 % off sale . i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night . they both seemed to be just what i was looking for . i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular as i am usually in between sizes . the 4 was definitely too small . the 6 fit technically but was very ill fitting . not only is the dress itself short but it is very short-waisted . i am only 5 ' 3 but it fe"

__label__0 "i love the designs of tiny blouses . but i wish they could make them more durable . i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam . and ironing or steaming them is a must . this blouse was no exception . it went back because of pulling at the bust . i 'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule but i should n't have to ! 5 ' 7"

__label__1 "this dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger . the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size . i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly . it is a bit short however so i would caution that it may not be work office appropriate if you are taller . like most hd in paris dresses it is also quite thin although lined . this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or"
__label__-1 "the quality and fabric of this dress are lovely but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless . it fit me like a sack i ordered the m and i suppose i should 've sized down but even in the s i 'm afraid this would be far too large . for reference i am 5 ' 7 and 135 lbs . i have a curvy build so this shape dress just was n't right on me . i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure . returned ."
__label__-1 "looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person runs very small . i returned it ."
__label__0 "despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it . i 'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small . the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i 'd said for more for a b . ( if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it ) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed . it was reticketed and it did n't really feel brand new when it arrived"
__label__-1 "as a tall girl i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs ! they are amazing for dressing up ( or sassing up ) and outfit . i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them . however as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor . after wearing them to they symphony the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat ! i really do n't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved . i 'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants !"
__label__0 "this is a beautiful and warm sweater well cut and easy to dress up or down . the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing especially against wool or cashmere winter coats ."
__label__1 "love love love this mock tank ! ! ! goes fabulous with everything ! it 's flows nicely the mock neck looks fantastic ! you can probably go one size down ."
__label__1 "these are super cute and i love the ties on the legs . fit is true to size . i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received . i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed . it did so i 'm stoked ."
__label__-1 "i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online . i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered it was comical . so so boxy . literally shaped like a square . it must be pinned back on this model . maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked ... or perhaps for a larger person it may look super cute ! just did n't work on my slim build . : ("
__label__-1 "this whole order was disappointing . the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made . there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it would n't stay so i 'll be returning it ."
__label__0 "although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well . i downsized two sizes and it still did n't hang well on my body . i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person . i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it ."
__label__1 "this dress is really beautiful . the material is soft and sways but it is sweater-like not flimsy . it does seem to run maybe a little large throughout but i liked that look . not form-fitting has more of a drape ."
__label__1 "on sale this is a great deal . the structure and fit of it are perfect- maybe runs a tad big but i liked that- it 's supposed to be a snug fit and is without being too clingy . i chose the berry color and love it- the ribbed style of fabric was n't as visible in the pic online but i do n't mind it in the darker color . can be worn with a bit of flair by unbuttoning the turtleneck or kept classic by not-"

__label__-1 "this runs sooo big ! i normally wear a large ( 145lb 5'-4 36dd ) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large . the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together ! i loved the pattern color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent lol . also the back is slightly longer than the front something i couldnt see from the pictures online ."
__label__1 "i did n't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold . yes it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work . the best feature ? even though it 's silk and the tag says dry clean only you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry . i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles ! i took my usual small ( i 'm 32c and 122 lbs ) and love how versatile this blouse will be ."
__label__1 "i have had my eye on this dress since the spring ( in yellow ) but it sold out quickly . i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall ! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely . i will be wearing this dress for family photos . the lace and the details are so very pretty ! i am usually a size 0 or 2 and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it . it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it ! wish it came in white !"

__label__1 "i was n't sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it 's by postmark and has an interesting cut . i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy . it is that and more ! the lightweight sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring . i look forward to wearing it tomorrow !"
__label__1 "i ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5 ' 8 with a long-ish torso . i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it 's fairly short . color was gorgeous . the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me . those with small chests may have better luck . i left like a suburban mom in it ."

__label__0 "i thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos . i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange . the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it can not be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it ( i 'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment ) . i was also confused by the front collar ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open folded over partly folded over - it just did n't seem to have a particular style to this area ."
__label__-1 "this top looks so pretty on the model . however the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose . i am petite but between a c+ to d cup . the top is not really fitted so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece . from the side it hung way in front of my body . i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model . if you are smaller chested and taller this top might look nice on you . i am 5 ' 1 105 lbs and c-d cup . i really loved the fabric and c"
__label__-1 "after reading the previous review i was pretty confident in ordering this dress . it arrived in the mail today and i was so disappointed . first of all it 's huge . the medium was way too big on me and i 'm never a small at retailer ! ( i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer . ) second the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo and the fabric felt cheap . finally it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that did n't fit right ."
__label__1 "this is even cuter in person than it is in the picture . it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room so i tried it on on a whim and loved it ! so so soft too ! runs true to size . i am 5 ' 2 and 125 and got a small ."
__label__1 "this blazer is really well made it has a nice weight and stretch to it . i think it might run a bit on the large size i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect . it 's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look . i do n't think the picture here does it justice . it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe . i love it !"
__label__1 "love bailey 44. this dress does not disappoint . the blue is beautiful and the fit is very flattering . the material is really soft and the dress is very comfortable ."
__label__0 "the white is completely sheer . i am so tired of see through shirts ! ! even at the sale on top of sale prices i would n't recommend this shirt . if the fabric were n't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back . but it just looks silly with a tank top under it the cotton just does n't lay right ."
__label__0 "this dress has a nice flow and it is simple but versatile . you can pair it with a jacket or cardigan for the winter and use it year round . however it runs one size large ."
__label__0 "i like what they were going for here and the fabric . but it falls short in that i ca n't wear it to work -- -the back keyhole is massive so i ca n't wear my normal bras and the very wide neck also shows bra straps so unless i want to go with a strapless bra it 's not useful for me . i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that . i 'd go without but that is a no-no where i work . i may try getting a size smaller . i wear a med . and i got a small and mayb"
__label__0 "like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo . i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men 's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves . the embroiding is beautiful but it also stops the material from stretching so the the super skinny legs are a real problem . also they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture . i decided to order them again one size bigger"
__label__-1 "cute enough but i could n't figure out what to do with the tie that did n't make it look like an extra set of sleeves oddly placed ."
__label__0 "this dress has been one that i just adored online and in the store so i was happy when i bought it on sale . i have worn this dress one time thinking that i would love it . the problem is that as i wore it the dress continued to stretch out of shape and just did nothing for my curvy bottom half . the dress just looked pulled and stretched out of shape . i would say that it may be the yarn and that it has too much give or at least more give than i want ."
__label__0 "i loved the look of this online and ordered the xs as maeve seems to run large and that was the smallest size offered . the length was good for me ( only 5 ' 4 ) . the elastic top fit well ( 32b ) but then from there it was too much fabric . i thought this would be a straight fit or a slight a-line but it was just a huge amount of fabric on me ... several inches on both sides big . i think with the large ruffle along the top and the tremendous amount of fabric hanging down from the dress underneath the ruf"
__label__-1 "this is more of a cover up than something you would wear out ."
__label__1 "this top is super flattering and comfortable . perfect summer wear !"
__label__0 "the cut and print of this dress is beautiful . however the armhole is way too low which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days . please do n't drop the armholes so low most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm !"
__label__-1 "dress is pretty i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer . i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings . nice but not nice enough to keep i am returning . : ("
__label__1 "loved the look of the blouse online but the one i received has weird pattern placement that i 'm not a fan of . mine was mostly cut from the mum/sunflower patterned fabric and none of the pretty teal and red pattern . the shirt online as a good combo of patterns -- mine is a solid mrs. roper-all-over-flower print ! way overboard ! ! that said -- the cut is cute and the yoke at the back is a nice detail -- hoping i can exchange it for one that looks more like the online pic !"
__label__0 "the positive : light-weight fabric interesting drape the negative : i 'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer . the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons -- three fell off the first time i wore it ... and it fits loosely ! they 're held on by a single loop ... ugh ."
__label__1 "these cords are a great skinny fit . they seem true to size for me and look great on . only issue i would have is the color says navy but they are more of a deep purple-ish color . i had to recheck my order because they definitely are n't navy .... but i 'm keeping them because the fit is awesome ."
__label__0 "these pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public . they are good quality and fit nicely but i feel like if you 're over 20 they 're not really flattering or especially appropriate ."
__label__-1 "this top looks beautiful online . when i got it it looks nothing like the pic . it 's wide too much fabric no shape and so unflattering . it 's definitely going back"
__label__0 "i love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they 're practically made of nothing but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric . however they run very large . being 100 lbs and about 5 ' i typically buy size 0 or xs but these looked a bit ridiculous on me with how big they are . i tried shrinking them in the wash since they 're 100 % cotton and that helped some along with getting rid of the creases from shipping"
__label__0 "i ordered a size 4 my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow . the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving . i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long . i do n't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy ."
__label__1 "this blouse is so pretty ! i love the design the material and the pattern is so unique . i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist . i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less . the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling . i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints ! ! ! i adore it and feel so good wearing it ! if i could change anything i 'd m"
__label__0 "i wanted to love it - the color is great the embroidery pretty but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much . if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you . i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer ."
__label__0 "first comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small which is not in line with most retailer pieces . i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close on top of being busty . the material is thin and mildly see thru but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top . i decided to keep it ."
__label__0 "this top runs very large . i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it 's a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric but the size was overwhelming so i returned it ."

__label__0 "i buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online . i would say size wise it 's consistent for tiny which in my opinion is in the runs small category as i 'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl . anyway the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top and if that snap pops open it 's open all the way down to the waist area where"
__label__1 "love this top ! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved . i wore it and ordered it in another color . i bought my usual size but decided i 'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one so i ordered down . it can go either way it 's quite flawy and roomy . cool for summer and supper flattering ."
__label__0 "so this is just the most lovely romper . beautifully made flowey . very comfortable until you have to take it off . this is the review i posted on facebook . so no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror or maybe has not shared with me that moment when you can not get out of because it has turned into a straight jacket that otherwise cute romper . and again maybe a man invented it !"
__label__-1 "i was so bummed when this came in ... the colors and print are beautiful but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo . there is also a liner which is a nice touch but it 's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts . definitely going back ."
__label__-1 "i love the design that 's why i 'm going back for a smaller size . i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i 'm good at choosing my size online but not today . if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room . also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on please !"
__label__1 "i adore this top ! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that 's been worn for years . it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round . even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders it still works and looks just fine . i 'm broad in the shoulders and we 'll endowed but the large was perfect ."
__label__1 "casual pretty . runs a little large especially through the waist but a great comfortable shirt ."
__label__-1 "really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews even with the sale price and addtl discount . it 's basically $ 30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse . the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily . if it were black you could probably get away with it but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle . sad to have to send it back ."
__label__0 "i had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim and these crops were made specifically for petites . also i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean not a skinny . the fit and sizing seems to be a little off . i ordered my regular size in this brand 27p but they were too big . sized down to a 26p . they were still too large in the waist ( seemed very stretchy ) but fit well in the legs . i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect"
__label__0 "i liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple ; however i feel that it was overpriced for the quality . it 's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale ."
__label__1 "i loved this top and i normally order petites when i 'm able to but this was n't offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular . just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow it is a petite ! but its not just runs small . i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out . i actually thought it was a bit too short too even on me ( 5 ' 2 about 118 lbs"
__label__0 "i wish his dress would have worked . it is beautiful ! ! however the waist and bust runs very small . the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick everything at your waist and hips will stick out ."

__label__1 "i was n't going to even try to see it this dress would fit . it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model . i 'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it ! my outfit is a floppy straw hat skinny leather belt and flat sandals . there 's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out . i ordered the medium petite and i am 5 ' 3 36dd 140 # ."
__label__1 "beautiful top ! the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid . it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out . my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight . i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome ."
__label__1 "my husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on . oohs and aaaahs galore with this one ! let 's let him review this one .... he says he loves the vibrant color length and the way the top is perfectly fitted . he was impressed with the lining and the mesh at the hem that keeps the 'flare ' in the skirt ( i had to explain that one ) ! he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees"

__label__1 "so i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite . i did n't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot . the dress came today and it fit great . i am 56 so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable . the material and cut is great . this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it . however the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i 'd even worn it so i thought it would probably only get worse . too bad because it 's gorgeous and flattering !"

__label__0 "i am a large in knit tees . this is the first tee where the large was just too big . it kind of hung on me . the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me . the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it . i liked the whole design a lot especially the front macrame part but for me it did not work at all . also too expensive for a tee ."
__label__-1 "i loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little . ummmmm no . it 's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model . i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay . i 'm only a 34b weigh 110 pounds 5 ' 3 and it made me look huge and awkward . this is going back !"
__label__0 "it was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me . i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite i 'd try it . it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy ."

__label__0 "the fit is definitely more straight-leg and not skinny as the photos seem to imply . at 4'11 and 95 lbs the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully and the length was great but the jean lost shape at the knee . i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit !"
__label__-1 "this did n't work for me . im normally a m ( 8/10 ) . got this in xs . that was the correct size for me i believe . however the armholes were huge . husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it . but i sent it back ."

__label__0 "i had mixed feelings about this dress . the material is lovely but the skirt is really odd . it has two slips one that fits close and a second that 's a bit too puffy . so the skirt did n't sit well and i thought it made my hips look bigger . the odd length made it unflattering . it might be nicer without the puffy slip but i did n't want to risk it ."

__label__0 "the fabric of this dress feels like suede i could n't stop touching it . here comes the but : the dress is cut straight down no definition . the rosette lace is sewn on like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap . i tried it on with a belt and by itself and i still feel like it 's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store . i 'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed . size s regu"
__label__0 "this dress is lovely ( albeit darker than it appears on the website ) but i had to return . it runs way small ? i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve ( this brand ) and could not even get this l on . would really only recommend for xs or s ladies ( maybe m ) who have the possibility of going larger . if you do purchase absolutely size up 1-2 sizes ."
__label__0 "the sweater fits a bit awkward in the front . it draped more than i would have liked . also the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching . returned the item ."
__label__0 "i really like the color of this and the feel but that is where it ends . it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves . i could purchase the belt with it but i do n't prefer to purchase products that can not stand on their own ."
__label__1 "i really love the colors of this top especially in the pinky pastels . it fits really well can be tied or untied and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts . speaking of that i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer am i hiding a pregnancy feel to it . but ... the price tag . $ 98 for a tank blouse is just too much for me . i will save this one in my shopping bag and hope it 's still available once it goes on sa"
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewers ; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist in an unflattering way . the rest of it was beautiful though . looks too much like maternity even in a petite xs so it 's going back ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress for my upcoming rehearsal dinner in early fall . i love the romantic lace and ivory color for the occasion . i ordered my typical size 10. it hits me right where it does on the model and it fits well on top but the dress bells more than the images let on . i did n't want to size down in fear that the neck would be too tight so i took it to an alterations specialist to get a lot of the lace fabric trimmed off . she took it in a little at the waste and the underarm and hacked q"
__label__0 "it 's a beautiful top but not for the price . very thin material ( not see-through though ) i fear it may easily rip ."
__label__1 "this dress is gorgeous ! ! amazing colors drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested . i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work ."
__label__1 "love this dress . the fit is amazing . i wore it to church for my brother 's wedding and got so many compliments . it looks great in photos too !"
__label__0 "this vibrant colors in this dress are beautiful but the fit is very off . you would assume a fit like this would be slimming and flattering at the waist but it somehow squished down my boobs and made my waist look wide . it also ran small ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewers this top is completely disappointing in every way i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag . where to begin ....... it runs really big it 's short and boxy not at all like it appears on the model this must be pinned a lot in this picture . colors are completely dull in person i really think this picture was lightened a great deal . fabric feels cheap and stiff lining is stuff and poorly sewn . i have n't one positive thing to say about t"
__label__0 "like the idea of this shirt so much . but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible . wishing the under layer really covered as no way i 'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt . might just be my body type so might work for someone else but sending back ."
__label__-1 "as another reviewer wrote .. this is not the same jean featured on the website . same cut and style but it 's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees . i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them . i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure ."

__label__-1 "too small ... too flare ... nice thick fabric . not my favorite pant ."
__label__1 "i loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues . same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that does n't wrinkle . i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt . will wear often ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this tunic sweater . the material is so soft and a perfect weight . the color is pretty . bu the fit absolutely did not work for me . the tunic runs very small . a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small . the slits are quite high . i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back !"
__label__0 "very cute shirt well made nice detail but a little long for my taste but i did keep it"
__label__1 "the delicate print and coloring are stunning . i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress . the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice . this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top . i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines"

__label__0 "i nearly always wear a size small and sometimes even a small is too large . not in this case ; this top is extremely snug . i would not be able to wear this and i would 've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me . in the online photo . the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow . i 'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag . but that 's just conjecture ."
__label__-1 "i bought this t-shirt in pink blue red grey and black over the past year . every one of them except the grey has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline . i 've returned them all . the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible ."
__label__-1 "what a disappointment and for the price it 's outrageous !"
__label__1 "love this shirt very flattering fit on my pear shape . also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons . ever so slightly sheer fabric but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra ."
__label__0 "for reference : 5 ' 3 130 # athletic/muscular body type ( broad shoulders slim hips ) i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it . perhaps the petite would have been better but there was just too much fabric everywhere . the sleeves were ridiculous on me and even cinching the waist with a belt just would n't have slimmed the silhouette for me . i have muscular shoulders and 34d chest so the top fit as it should just everything became way too much elsewhere . the fabric was soft and sw"
__label__0 "i loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts . the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area ... also there were a lot of thread h"
__label__0 "this top was a disappointment for me . it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it 's shape . it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south .... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape ."
__label__1 "this general sweatshirt is cute stylish and can be dressed up or down . a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings ."
__label__1 "i also agree that this piece ran very small . my normal size did not zip up . i sized up a size and it pulled across my thighs . i sized up two sizes and it fit as i had hoped it would . if you get the right size it is beautiful on . the colors are so fun and i love the side slit . i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer and it is definitely a statement piece ."
__label__-1 "do not buy these pants ! the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots and i followed the washing instructions . i bought another pair and the same thing happened . i 'm out a bunch of money !"
__label__1 "the material feels nice and i love the flared arms ."
__label__0 "i am usually a size 2 in tops . i am very very rarely a size 0 so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does . obviously this is designed to be a loose flowing top . that 's why i wanted to order it . however the 2 is simply too loose in every direction . my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i do n't think it intended . i do really like the styling and quality so i am planning on"
__label__0 "i really loved the look of this dress online and could n't wait to try it on . based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium following the petite size chart . the dress was the perfect length for my 5 ' 5 frame but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure . i 'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress . the fabric and lining feel great though . i just was n't the right fit for me ."
__label__0 "i ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape . when it arrived it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty muted pink . however once i put it on it clinged to all the wrong places . having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i ca n't wear a standard bra with it it 's too complicated . in a regular tank dress it would have been a yes . overall a great dress but probably for another body type ."
__label__1 "these jeans fit so well and are made of really high quality denim . soft and comfortable but not too much stretch ... just enough . i 'm short so i have to cuff them . i kinda wish they came in petite or ankle length but they look cute cuffed too ."
__label__0 "i saw this online and loved it . plus after reading the reviews i thought why not . but if you have a big chest beware . i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium . the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small . had to return ."
__label__1 "this top is simple but beautiful . i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl . it is a swing top but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing . i am around 5 ' 6 and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all . i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks . the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like . a great staple for your closet ."
__label__-1 "i loved fabric print and back detail . design however was a little too boxy to be flattering on me . even at great price i sent it back ."
__label__0 "i loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5 ' 7 frame . the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back . i could see this looking great on a really petite frame . runs large xs fit however was n't flattering"
__label__0 "i loved the fit color and style but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap . i was worried that it would tear easily . this is getting returned ."
__label__1 "i have received so many compliments . it 's my favorite"
__label__1 "good quality shirt . cute design and not sheer . not quite as loose and stretchy as most of retailer 's shirt but good fit ."
__label__-1 "the cut and color of the dress is awesome . however the biggest flaw is the zipper . i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke .. sad day especially at the price . there also were a number of loose threads . i recommend waiting until it goes on sale . you 'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper ."
__label__1 "this is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished ! it is not a cheap polyester fabric as one reviewer wrote . it is a rayon and nylon blend . it does wrinkle easily . i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back . i do n't typically gravitate toward warm color palette but the burnt orange color is really lovely . it can be dressed up or down very easily . and it has pockets ! i typically wear xs in retailer brands and the size 0 fit me well ."
__label__-1 "the skirt is just okay . the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through . there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well . the pleats are okay but not great . overall it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that . and again be wary of it being see through ."
__label__-1 "i ordered these in m ( 5 ' 8 140 lbs . ) and they are tts : they fit well and are neither tight nor loose . the issue that i have with them ( and the reason that i sent them back ) is that the material although comfortable is completely transparent ; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless ! furthermore these are not white but off-white ( and quite a yellowy off-white at that ) so these loungers do n't look as cute with the feature"
__label__1 "i think the fabric is very nice and soft . i find this top runs very large . i am 5 ' 2 130l . normally wear a small in a shirt . i should have ordered xs it is very large . i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size . the shoulder area fits fine . i may try tucking it in . other than size a nice top ."
__label__1 "the materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous but the large was absolute gigantic . i 'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small which is unreal since i wear a size ten normally ! i am petite height-wise but more than length there was just so much room width-wise . it swallowed me ! the dress itself is lovely though so i 'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size . but definitely size down !"
__label__-1 "beautiful dress but have to return . way too big & long for me . medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small ."
__label__1 "these jeans are worth every penny ! they fit me perfectly as soon as i put them on and i wore them the rest of the day ! they are true to size with very generous stretch ... if anything i would size down . they feel durable but not like typical denim . very soft . i am 5 ' 3 and about 117 or so and my normal 25 fit like a dream . i did end up exchanging these because there was a small nick on the inside of the left thigh and i was afraid they might tear right open . if the new pair comes without defe"
__label__-1 "i saw this one for the first time today in-store and was not impressed . it is a lacey material with an under-layer so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous . unfortunately i did not like the swing dress cut especially not in white . i was n't sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the 70s or a shortened version of my grandmother 's wedding gown but either way it was not working for me . to be fair swing dr"
__label__1 "the fit and style of this dress are beautiful . it 's a bouncy fabric that is light and comfortable . i really wanted to love it but the color just did n't work for me . the pictures make it look like it 's a nice cream color but it 's very tan and i ca n't pull it off with my coloring ."
__label__-1 "this product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress . it 's pretty bad when it wo n't even zip up on the hanger . such a beautiful dress ; it broke my heart !"
__label__1 "i highly recommend this dress ! ! ! ! ! ! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static but nothing that a little static guard could n't prevent ! : ) i purchased a medium petite and i am about 5 feet tall usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect ! ( wore for thanksgiving ) the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk which i love ! !"
__label__-1 "would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves . i 'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium . the fabric was amazing . the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste . i 'm 5 ' 7 and 140. this landed mid calf . not my preference . retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it ."
__label__0 "this piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms or if you are a t-rex . if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms this top may not be for you ."
__label__0 "just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress ! you ca n't tell from the pictures . i ordered thinking it was a dress but it 's actually ... culottes ? i 'm not sure what you would call it . the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky . it definitely goes back !"
__label__0 "really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering . but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap . would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished . not worth full price"
__label__1 "this is a fabulous style top ! highly recommend this top . comfortable material . retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style !"
__label__-1 "this dress is so beautiful in person ! but the quality was very upsetting . i had two buttons come off before even putting it on . i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i could n't wear it : ("
__label__1 "it 's definitely not a $ 100 blouse but i took advantage of the sale on sale and got ta say i love it ! it 's slightly sheer but with a plain nude bra it 's fine . beautiful details very retro light and breezy . wearing it to work and with jeans ."
__label__0 "originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping . the fit is completely different . i am a consistent small particularly in dresses of this style . will be exchanging this for a medium which i hope will fit . love the color and pattern ."
__label__1 "the patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person . it is lined and feels very well made . the pockets do n't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do which is great . the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves . if you can try this one on in a store before buying . for reference : i am 5 ' 7 have broad shoulders am pear shaped ( i have hips and a good sized rear end ) 34b bust weigh 145 lbs . and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms . the size 8 fit"
__label__0 "i first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater : the stitch is pretty but the fabric is n't nearly as soft as i expected . it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater . that said the fit is pretty flattering . i did n't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model . i 've been looking for this style of sweater so i 'll probably keep it . however it really did n't meet my expectations for quality ."
__label__1 "this is nicer than the first reviewer states . the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders . i will have to get a larger size ."
__label__-1 "this is a very slimming well-made nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors . they did not look good on me . otherwise this is a very nice piece !"
__label__-1 "the fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it 's hard to believe this is anna sui . i would say this is unwearable . there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best . going back asap ."
__label__-1 "material is awful . not soft at all . colors are much darker than shows online . it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model . it went back ."
__label__0 "i 'm so disappointed with the fit of this top . it is extremely short even for my 5 ' 2 frame . sizing up will not fix the length . too bad because the shirt is cute ."
__label__-1 "i recommend this product but with the following reservations . the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit . i love the fit and make of the jumper but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day . this is still happening after several washes which makes me feel disappointed . it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely ."
__label__1 "the photo does n't do it justice . the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans . texture is light and gauze-y but i do n't find it too see-though . sizing was tough- i 'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s and went with the xs on this ( ordered both to try ) sacrificing some length for a more flattering width . great for the sale price ! ! !"
__label__-1 "super soft fabric however very short in the stride . i ordered an xl normally wear 12/14 . i had to return it ."
__label__1 "this is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric . it seems to fit tts and the cut is very flattering . however - the white is actually ivory . not a big deal unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it . still on the fence about whether to keep it or not ."
__label__-1 "i found the fit of this dress odd . i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses . the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge . i am a 34c so i need some type of support . i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price . i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store ."
__label__0 "this jacket is cozy warm and very cute but after the 1st washing ( according to the manufacturer 's instructions ) it began to pill and has worsened each time ."
__label__-1 "i did n't think top was very flattering and while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd . this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom ... just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful . sadly this one is going back to the store ."
__label__1 "i really like the appearance of this item and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings . it does run a little large . i am a true to size small and this hangs on me a little but i love the design of the back . it is so soft and comfortable !"
__label__0 "i get that it 's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all ."
__label__0 "this dress is stunning no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif thick material nicely cut with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly . however the fact that this dress has zero stretch ( which is fine if that 's what you 're looking for ) coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured make this dress exhausting to put on . i 'm normally a 14/16 at retailer and i ordered the 16 just to be safe and the waist is exactly the size of my waist"
__label__1 "this dress is very soft and ultra comfortable . i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length even though i got the regular and not the petite ."
__label__-1 "i loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress . it 's loose and flows but does n't look like a potato sack . i wore it once and got a ton of compliments . that said i hand washed it as the tag states then let it line dry and it shrunk to half its size ! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states dry clean recommended . boo . so disappointed that i spend over $ 100 for a dress i wore once ."
__label__-1 "this blouse has too much drapey fabric and it 's just not flattering . in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit . sending back ."
__label__0 "this is a very cute shirt with great details . however it runs a little bit small . not as full cut as it seems ."
__label__1 "i agree with other reviews soft cozy and love the embroidery and beading . it is a bit wrinkly even after i ironed it but overall happy with this blouse ."
__label__1 "this skirt is so cute . the fix print is really nice . it 's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe ."
__label__0 "this dress is very pretty colorwise but the fit did not work for me . i could see this working on girls with narrow hips but it did n't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame ."
__label__1 "the fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering it does n't stick out too far over the butt . the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall . looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights . i 'm usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one ."
__label__1 "this is a stunning flattering well-designed and sized magnificent and yet wearable comfortable summer blouse ! i am a busty 34f size 8 and this lovely piece makes me look amazing . i most highly recommend to any woman . the 100 % cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of give . i experienced no pulling at the chest or back which can happen for me . the bottom 2 of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top so you may not need a cami . the combination of leaf print/crochet"
__label__1 "this robe is warm soft and i like how long it is ! it 's perfect length . my favorite thing to wear around the house !"
__label__0 "love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it . if it was a dark color i would buy it . wore my regular size small . i 'm 5'5130lbs and 32dd ."
__label__0 "i ordered this dress in small my usual size ( for reference : 5 ' 7 125 lb ) . it is too wide . it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me . the belt does not help much ; it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her mom 's dress . also i found that the material crumples easily ."
__label__1 "love the leggings . very soft and comfortable . i ordered two pair -one s/m and one m/l . the s/m fit better on me but both will work ."
__label__0 "this top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model . it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom which normally i like but not this time . sad ."
__label__0 "cute dress ... but akward fit . sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size ."
__label__1 "what i like about this is the yellow color peeking through the white it makes the tank look sunny/happy . soft tank fabric is really comfortable fit is loose and casual i was undecided but thought i have so many nice pieces i do n't need this one . xsp was a good fit . i am 115 lbs 30 dd ."
__label__-1 "this top is huge ! i 'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge . it 's wider than it is long . even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric . i 'm so disappointed ! beautiful color and fabric but there 's so much fabric . i love a flowy top but this one is way too much . : ( i will be returning this top ."
__label__-1 "this is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide . very disappointing ! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me . i do n't usually wear xxs . it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white ."
__label__-1 "the price is high and i have to dry clean this ? no thanks ."
__label__-1 "ordered a l and xl the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose . the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt . both sizes had to be returned ."
__label__1 "got this in the dark blue wash ; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online ; it 's a medium wash and incredibly soft . i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps : if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes go with your larger size . this feels incredibly silky . it 's lightweight so it can be worn ( almost ) year-round and will layer well over say a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter . it 's longer in the b"

__label__1 "i love these shorts . i do n't understand why they are n't sold out yet ! they are buttery soft and fit great . i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size . they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even . love ! !"
__label__-1 "loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size . boy do i regret that ! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit ... not attractive . wish i could return them but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand ! ! if in between sizes definitely size down ."
__label__0 "yes i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away . it 's not mean for everybody . it would look good on a stick figure . if you have some hips they balloon out ."
